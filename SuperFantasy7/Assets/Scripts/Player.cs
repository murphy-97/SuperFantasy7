/*

The "Player" is an entity that is detached from the actual player character!
This is where we keep track of a player's progress that carries over after death
(special items acquired, skill points acquired, etc). Anything that is specific
to a single life should be defined in Player_Char.cs, the entity that is the
player's current charcter instance.
